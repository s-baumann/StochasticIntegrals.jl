This includes finding the variance and instantaneous volatility of an ito integral; for extracting the terminal correlation & covariance of a pair of stochastic integrals over a period of time; for generation of random draws from the set of Ito integrals (either pseudorandom or quasirandom). Given a draw of stochastic integrals, it is also possible to find the density of the multivariate normal distribution at this point.

We would usually be more interested in the statistical properties of the Ito integrals at a point forward in time. This can be done by generating a CovarianceAtDate object. We must first specify the start and end limits on each integral. Below we look at the integrals  between 0.0 and 2.0. More generally time can be specified in Dates format.

In particular a covariance matrix is generated as well as its inverse, Cholesky decomposition and determinant. These can be accessed directly in the normal way.
